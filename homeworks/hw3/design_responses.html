						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article I learned about ratios of font sizes and that a golden ratio of font sizes exists as well.
								Whenever I changed fonts depending on context, I always just eyed it and hoped it looked fine to everyone else too. 
								Being more aware of ratios would definitely help with digital visualization. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was finding out about inspiration sources. It was nice to know that there were sites already
								made to pair fonts that looked together so I dont have to take hours scrolling through fonts and trying them one by one.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
