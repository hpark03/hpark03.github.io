							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> Most people are not very aware that design, UI, UX have relations to cognitive science and psychology. This article captured that explanation very well and explained how the science behind our visual processes contribute to effective design. A good example was sustained attention and how everything on the website interface should serve to focus the user on the main subject. Another example was how design needs to reduce cognitive overload so the actual things on there are actually perceived. </p>
