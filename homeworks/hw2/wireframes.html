					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> CS61B.org </p>
							<img src = assets/imgs/before.png>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> CS61B.org </p>
							<img src = assets/imgs/after.png>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to inform students taking the class COMPSCI 61B anything regarding the course and its material. The intended audience are ths students. There is a calendar on 
								the first page of the website, which is what students utilize the most when checking assignment, project, and exam dates. Below the assignment table are two other tables that students 
								frequently use (office hours and labs). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> One thing I changed was I increased the visibility of the links to the calendar, sections, and OH hours because I noticed while using the website that the three links 
								weren't really visible beforehand. I actually didn't even realize the links were there until I did this assignment and always scrolled all the way to the bottom to find the OH and section hours.
								Another thing I changed was that I combined labs and assignments and instead of assignments and exams because the majority of the class is full of project deadlines with only 0-1 homework assignments 
								1 lab assignment every week. Having projects and exams and assignments all in one column made some of the boxes look too overcrowded and confusing. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
