					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> It was cool to see examples of things designers take into account that I never thought twice about. For example,
								the exclamation point addition to a red text box wasn't something I realized before. I didn't really think about how 
								the lack of an exclamation point could lead to people not seeing the error as well.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how the article made sure to include how accessibility of color takes into account color blind people. 
								The inclusivity and emphasis on the importance of uniqueness other design aspects was nice to see. I don't think this
								is an aspect that too many websites take into account for, as I have not seen it very often.  </p>
