				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned in this article that dark patterns in UX is a lot more common than I thought. I knew there were deceptive elements that UX designers purposefully used, but I thought they were rather rare. It wasn't until I read throough all the examples that I realized I encountered so many of these online without even realizing they were meant to trick the user.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I think the example showing Sky iD was pretty funny. You would think there's no way anyone would write something that obviously deceptive. All these examples really demonstrate that we should be more careful when scanning through websites.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave." </p>
					</li>
