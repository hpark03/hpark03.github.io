						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that gestalt principles are used even in UI. 
								I learned about it previously in my psychology classes but it's interesting to see how it plays a part in design as well.
								It's cool to see how the human perception is very important when it comes to design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think my favorite part of the article was seeing all the visual examples of the gestalt principles.
								The description does a good job but seeing the designs visually helped in realizing how exactly some elements are perceived to be related to each other. 
								It's also fun to see how even within one principle, there are so many different ways to execute it.</p>
