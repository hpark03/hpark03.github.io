        <p>
            Hi! I'm Hannah, currently a sophomore studying cognitive science and computer science. 
            When I'm not studying or catching up on sleep, you can catch me listening to music (kballads, krnb), reading fiction, or playing cozy/chill videogames.
            Something random about me is that I find a lot of joy in aesthetics whether that be in something like design or fashion.

            <li>I learned that even the smallest details on the design of a website can be intentionally designed for reasons other than aesthetic purpose.</li>
            <li>I never really noticed how some search bars have different text in them like AirBNB's "Try 'London'". It was interesting to see it pointed out. </li>
